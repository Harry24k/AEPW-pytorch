# AEPW-pytorch
**A pytorch implementation of "[Adversarial Examples in the Physical World](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533)"**

## Summary
This code is a pytorch implementation of **basic iterative method(known as I-FGSM) and iterative least-likely class method.**   
In this code, I used above methods to fool [Inception v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567).   
'[Giant Panda](http://www.image-net.org/)' used for an example.   
You can add other pictures with a folder with the label name in the 'data/imagenet'.   

Also, this code shows adversarial attack is possible with a photo if an adversarial image. 

## Requirements
* python==3.6   
* numpy==1.14.2   
* pytorch==1.0.0   

## Important results not in the code
- This paper proposed new metric(called _destruction rate_) to measure the influence of arbitrary trasnfromations. (p.6)
  - Destruction rate is the fraction of adversarial images which are no longer misclassified after the transformations.
  - Adversarial examples generated by the FGSM are the most robust to transformations.
  - Iterative least-likely method is the least robust.
  - Blur, noise and JPEG encoding have a higher destruction rate than brightness and contrast.
- Paper shows that, to obtain very high confidence, iterative methods are weak to survive photo transformation. (p.8-9)
  - prefiltered case(clean image correctly classified, adversarial image confidently incorrectly classified) couldn't fool the model after transformations unlike average case(randomly chosen images)
